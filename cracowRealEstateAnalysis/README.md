# Cracow_RealEstate_Analysis
Cracow real estate data gathering and analysis

Project plan:

1. Create web scrapper which will be able to gather data from otodom.pl (as detailed as possible) on a daily basis.
2. Use scrapped data to come up with a house pricing model, get insight regarding house size/price for meter, location/size for meter.
3. Gather some weekly or monthly datapoints for average price tracking.

More detailed overview to be done.
